# ANUBIS - Astrophysical Nonparametrically Upgraded Bayesian Inference of Subpopulations

[ANUBIS](https://github.com/sterinaldi/ANUBIS) implements the inference of a multivariate probability density given a set of samples and an (incomplete) parametric model.
The Heterogeneous Mixture Model, or HMM, is a finite mixture of parametric models augmented with DPGMM to capture the eventual features missed by the parametric model.

Please install this code with `pip install anubis` (stable version) or `pip install .` after cloning this repository (development version, potentially unstable).
